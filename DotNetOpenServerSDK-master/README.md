# DotNetOpenServer SDK

## Overview
[DotNetOpenServer SDK](http://www.UpperSetting.com/DotNetOpenServer) is an open
source lightweight fully extendable TCP socket client/server application
framework enabling developers to create highly efficient, fast, secure and
robust cloud based smart mobile device and desktop applications. Why? Unlike
most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow inefficient
stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use ASCII data formats such
as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up with highly
efficient stateful binary protocols.
